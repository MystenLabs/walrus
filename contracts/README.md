# Contracts Development

This directory contains the contracts that are currently under development. The `VERSION` in
the contracts sources (`walrus/sources/staking.move`, `walrus/sources/system.move`,
`subsidies/sources/subsidies.move`) must be `1` more than the values in `testnet-contracts`.
The `mainnet-contracts` directory contains the contracts currently deployed on Mainnet,
whereas `testnet-contracts` contains the contracts deployed on Testnet.
