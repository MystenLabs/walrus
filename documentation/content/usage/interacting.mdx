title: Interacting with Walrus
---

We provide 3 ways to interact directly with the Walrus storage system:

- Through the Walrus [client command line interface (CLI)](/usage/client-cli.mdx).
- Through a [JSON API](/usage/json-api.mdx) of the Walrus CLI.
- Through an [HTTP API](/usage/web-api.mdx) exposed by a public or local Walrus client daemon.

Furthermore, users can [stake and unstake](/usage/stake.mdx) through the staking dApp or Sui smart
contracts.
