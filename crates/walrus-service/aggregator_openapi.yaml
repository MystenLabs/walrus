        object or a shared blob), then uses the blob ID from that metadata to fetch the actual blob
        data via the get_blob function. The response includes the raw data along with any attribute

        Reconstructs the blob identified by the provided blob ID from Walrus and returns its raw data.

        # HTTP Range Support

        This endpoint also accepts the HTTP `Range` header to request only a portion of the blob.
        When a `Range` header is provided with a specific byte range (e.g., `bytes=100-199`), the
        endpoint returns HTTP 206 Partial Content with the requested byte range.

        **Important**: When using byte range requests, only the consistency of the individual fetched
        slivers is validated. The entire blob's consistency is NOT validated, which provides better
        performance for partial reads but with reduced integrity guarantees compared to full blob reads.

        # Range Header Format

        - `bytes=start-end`: Returns bytes from start to end (inclusive)
        - `bytes=start-`: Not supported yet (TODO(WAL-1108))
        - `bytes=-end`: Not supported yet

        # Examples

        ```bash
        # Get full blob
        curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/{blob_id}"

        # Get first 1000 bytes

          enable the previous strict consistency check. See

      description: |-
        Reads a specific portion of a blob identified by the blob ID, starting from a given byte
        position and reading a specified number of bytes. This is more efficient than retrieving the
        entire blob when only a portion is needed.

        Note that this endpoint has reduced consistency guarantees compared to the full blob read
        since it will only validate the consistency of individual fetched slivers.

        # Query Parameters
        - `start`: The starting byte position (0-indexed, inclusive)
        - `length`: The number of bytes to read

        # Validation
        - `start` and `length` must not overflow when added together
        - The byte range `[start, start + length)` must be within the blob's size
        - `length` must be greater than 0

        # Example
        ```bash
        # Read 1024 bytes starting from position 0

            When enabled, this flag bypasses all consistency verification during blob reading. This
            should be used only when the writer of the blob is trusted. Does *not* affect any
            authentication checks for data received from storage nodes, which are always performed.

            This was the default before `v1.37`. In `v1.37`, the default consistency was changed to a
            more performant one, which is sufficient for the majority of cases. This flag can be used to
            enable the previous strict consistency check. See
            <https://docs.wal.app/design/encoding.html#data-integrity-and-consistency> for more details.
