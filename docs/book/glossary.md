# Walrus Glossary

To make communication as clear and efficient as possible, we make sure to use a single term for
every Walrus entity/concept and *do not* use any synonyms. The following table lists various
concepts, their canonical name, and how they relate to or differ from other terms.

Italicized terms in the description indicate other specific Walrus terms contained in the table.

| reconstruction (of a blob)        | decoding of the primary *slivers* to obtain the blob; includes re-encoding the *blob* and checking the Merkle proofs                                                                        |

| RedStuff                          | our erasure-encoding approach, which uses two different encodings (*primary* and *secondary*) to enable shard recovery; details are available in the [whitepaper](./walrus.pdf)             |
| shard                             | (disjoint) subset of erasure-encoded data of all *blobs*; at every point in time, a *shard* is assigned to and stored on a single *SN*                                                      |
