# Developer guide

This guide introduces all the concepts needed to build applications that use Walrus as a storage
or availability layer. The [overview](../design/overview.md) provides more background and explains
in more detail how Walrus operates internally.

This developer guide describes the following:

- [Components](components.md) of Walrus of interest to developers that wish to use it for
  storage or availability.
- [Operations](dev-operations.md) supported through client binaries, APIs, or Sui operations.
- [The Sui structures](sui-struct.md) Walrus uses to store metadata, and how they can be read
  from Sui smart contracts, or through the Sui SDK.

Refer again to the [glossary](../glossary.md) of terms as a reference.
