# Announcing Mainnet

Published on: 2025-03-27

## A production decentralized network: Mainnet

The big news today is that Walrus graduates, and a production Mainnet is now live, operated by
a decentralized network of over 100 storage nodes. Epoch 1 begun on March 25, 2025. The
network can now be used to [publish and retrieve blobs](), [upload and browse Walrus Sites](), as
well as [stake and unstake]() to determine future committees using the live [Mainnet WAL token]().
The Walrus protocol health is overseen by an [independent foundation]() that is now
[well resourced]() to support future development and growth.

All this to say: Walrus is ready for prime time. On Mainnet the security properties and other
promises of Walrus should hold. And Walrus is now ready to satisfy the needs of real applications.

This is a significant milestone a little over 12 months after an initial small team started
designing the Walrus protocol. And a special thanks is due to the community of storage operators
that supported the development of Walrus through consecutive Testnet(s), as well as all
community members that integrated the protocol early and provided feedback to improve it.

## New features

Besides the promise of stability and security, the Mainnet release of Walrus comes with a few
notable new features and changes:

- A production staking app. You can now use WAL to stake and unstake to determine the composition
  of future Walrus storage committees.

- Blob attributes.
- Commands to burn blob objects on Sui.
- New encoding scheme, RedStuff with Reed-Solomon underlying codes.
- TLS handing for storage node.
- Health command and endpoint.
- CLI expiry time improvements.
- JWT auth layer for Publisher
