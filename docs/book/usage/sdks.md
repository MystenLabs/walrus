# Software development kits (SDKs) and other tools

Mysten Labs has built and published a [Walrus TypeScript SDK](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/walrus),
which supports a wide variety of operations. See also the related
[examples](https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/walrus/examples).

The Walrus core team is also actively working on a Rust SDK for Walrus, which will be made available
some time after the Mainnet launch.

Besides these official SDKs, there also exist a few unofficial third-party SDKs for interacting
with the [HTTP API](./web-api.md#http-api-usage) exposed by Walrus aggregators and publishers:

- [Walrus Go SDK](https://github.com/namihq/walrus-go) (maintained by the *Nami Cloud* team)
- [Walrus PHP SDK](https://github.com/suicore/walrus-sdk-php) (maintained by the *Suicore* team)

Finally, there is [Tusky](https://docs.tusky.io/about/about-tusky), a complete data storage platform
built on Walrus, including encryption, HTTP APIs, sharing capabilities, and more.
Tusky maintains its own [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/tusky-io/ts-sdk).
