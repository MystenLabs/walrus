# Getting started

You want to get a taste of Walrus? Here are some distributed applications (dapps) that
you can use from your browser:

- [Publish a blob and see it](https://publish.wal.app) on Walrus.
- [Mint a toy NFT](https://flatland.wal.app) on the flatland application.

The above dapps are on the Walrus *Testnet*, which provides a sandbox for experimentation, and
uses tokens with no value. To use or develop against the Walrus Mainnet you will need to use real
WAL and SUI tokens.

You can explore blobs that are stored on Walrus through the [Walruscan explorer](https://walruscan.com).
