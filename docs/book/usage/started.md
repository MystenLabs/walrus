# Getting Started

You want to get a taste of Walrus? Here are some distributed applications (dapps) that
you can use from your browser:

* [Publish a blob and see it](https://publish.walrus.site/) on Walrus.
* [Explore](https://walruscan.com/testnet/home) blob uploads and meta-data on the Walrus explorer.
* [Mint a toy NFT](https://flatland.walrus.site/) on the flatland application.

The above dapps are on the Walrus *testnet*, which provides a sandbox for experimentation, and
uses tokens with no value. To use or develop against the Walrus mainnet you will need to use real
WAL and SUI tokens.
