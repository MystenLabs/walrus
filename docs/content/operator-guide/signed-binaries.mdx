This document explains how to download and verify signed Walrus binaries and Docker images.

## Overview

Walrus release binaries and Docker images are signed using
[Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) with a GCP KMS key. Each binary has a
corresponding `.sig` file containing its signature, and Docker image signatures are stored
in the registry.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)
2. Install the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (for downloading binaries)

## Using the verification script

The easiest way to download and verify binaries is using the provided script:

```bash
# Download the script
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MystenLabs/walrus/main/scripts/verify-release.sh -o verify-release.sh
chmod +x verify-release.sh
```

### List available binaries

```bash
./verify-release.sh list -r <ref>
```

Where `<ref>` is a git reference (branch, tag, or commit SHA).

### Download and verify a binary

```bash
# Download a binary
./verify-release.sh download -r v1.0.0 -b walrus -p ubuntu-x86_64 -o ./walrus

# Verify the downloaded binary
./verify-release.sh verify -b ./walrus
```

### Available platforms

| Platform | Option value |
|----------|--------------|
| Linux x86_64 | `ubuntu-x86_64` |
| Linux ARM64 | `ubuntu-aarch64` |
| macOS x86_64 | `macos-x86_64` |
| macOS ARM64 | `macos-arm64` |
| Windows x86_64 | `windows-x86_64.exe` |

### Available binaries

| Binary | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `walrus` | The Walrus CLI client |
| `walrus-node` | The Walrus storage node |
| `walrus-upload-relay` | The Walrus upload relay service |

### Verify a Docker image

```bash
# Verify a signed Docker image
./verify-release.sh docker -i mysten/walrus-service:abc123-signed
```

### Using GCP KMS key directly

If you have GCP access, you can verify using the KMS key directly:

```bash
# Authenticate with GCP first
gcloud auth application-default login

# Verify using KMS key
./verify-release.sh verify -b ./walrus --use-kms
./verify-release.sh docker -i mysten/walrus-service:abc123-signed --use-kms
```

## Manual verification

If you prefer to verify manually without the script:

### Download binaries

Signed binaries are stored in Google Cloud Storage:

```bash
# Download the binary
gcloud storage cp gs://mysten-walrus-binaries/signed/<ref>/walrus-ubuntu-x86_64 ./walrus

# Download the signature
gcloud storage cp gs://mysten-walrus-binaries/signed/<ref>/walrus-ubuntu-x86_64.sig ./walrus.sig
```

### Verify using the public key

```bash
# Download the public key
curl -sSfL https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-signing.pub -o walrus-signing.pub

# Verify the binary
cosign verify-blob \
  --key walrus-signing.pub \
  --signature walrus.sig \
  --insecure-ignore-tlog \
  walrus
```

On success, you'll see:

```
Verified OK
```

:::note
The `--insecure-ignore-tlog` flag is required because signatures are not uploaded
to the Sigstore transparency log. Verification is still cryptographically secure using
the signing key.
:::

### Verify using GCP KMS key directly

If you have GCP access:

```bash
# Authenticate with GCP
gcloud auth application-default login

# Verify the binary
cosign verify-blob \
  --key gcpkms://projects/walrus-infra/locations/global/keyRings/walrus-signing/cryptoKeys/release-sign \
  --signature walrus.sig \
  --insecure-ignore-tlog \
  walrus
```

## Docker images

Signed Docker images are available with the `-signed` suffix:

- `mysten/walrus-service:<sha>-signed` - Walrus storage node service
- `mysten/walrus-upload-relay:<sha>-signed` - Walrus upload relay service

Where `<sha>` is the git commit SHA used to build the image.

### Verify a Docker image manually

```bash
# Using the public key
curl -sSfL https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-signing.pub -o walrus-signing.pub
cosign verify --key walrus-signing.pub mysten/walrus-service:abc123-signed

# Or using GCP KMS key directly
cosign verify \
  --key gcpkms://projects/walrus-infra/locations/global/keyRings/walrus-signing/cryptoKeys/release-sign \
  mysten/walrus-service:abc123-signed
```

### Verify the image digest matches

To ensure the image you pulled matches what was signed:

```bash
# Get the digest of your local image
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' mysten/walrus-service:abc123-signed

# Compare with the digest shown in the cosign verify output
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission denied when verifying

If you get a permission denied error when using the GCP KMS key directly:
- Authenticate with GCP: `gcloud auth application-default login`
- Or use the public key method instead

### Signature verification failed

If verification fails:
1. Ensure you downloaded both the binary and signature for the same version
2. Ensure the files weren't corrupted during download
3. Try re-downloading both files

### "no matching signatures" error for Docker images

If you see `Error: no matching signatures`:
1. Ensure the image tag includes the `-signed` suffix
2. Verify the commit SHA is correct
3. Check that the image was actually signed

### Image not found

If the Docker image is not found:
1. Verify the commit SHA exists in the repository
2. Check that the signed binaries workflow ran successfully for that commit
3. Ensure you're using the correct image name

## Security

- The signing key is stored in GCP KMS and cannot be exported
- Only authorized CI/CD workflows can sign binaries and images
- Each binary is signed individually, not just the archive
- Docker image signatures are stored in the registry alongside the image
