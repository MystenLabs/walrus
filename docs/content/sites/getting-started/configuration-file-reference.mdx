The `site-builder` tool requires a configuration file `sites-config.yaml` to specify which Sui package to use, which wallet to use, the gas budget, and other operational details. The following is an example `sites-config.yaml`:

```yaml
contexts:
  testnet:
    # module: site
    # portal: wal.app
    package: 0xf99aee9f21493e1590e7e5a9aea6f343a1f381031a04a732724871fc294be799
    staking_object: 0xbe46180321c30aab2f8b3501e24048377287fa708018a5b7c2792b35fe339ee3
    general:
        wallet_env: testnet
        walrus_context: testnet # Assumes a Walrus CLI setup with a multi-config containing the "testnet" context.
        walrus_package: 0xd84704c17fc870b8764832c535aa6b11f21a95cd6f5bb38a9b07d2cf42220c66
        # wallet_address: 0x1234...
        # rpc_url: https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
        # wallet: /path/to/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml
        # walrus_binary: /path/to/walrus
        # walrus_config: /path/to/testnet/client_config.yaml
        # gas_budget: 500000000
  mainnet:
    # module: site
    # portal: wal.app
    package: 0x26eb7ee8688da02c5f671679524e379f0b837a12f1d1d799f255b7eea260ad27
    staking_object: 0x10b9d30c28448939ce6c4d6c6e0ffce4a7f8a4ada8248bdad09ef8b70e4a3904
    general:
        wallet_env: mainnet
        walrus_context: mainnet # Assumes a Walrus CLI setup with a multi-config containing the "mainnet" context.
        walrus_package: 0xfdc88f7d7cf30afab2f82e8380d11ee8f70efb90e863d1de8616fae1bb09ea77
        # wallet_address: 0x1234...
        # rpc_url: https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
        # wallet: /path/to/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml
        # walrus_binary: /path/to/walrus
        # walrus_config: /path/to/mainnet/client_config.yaml
        # gas_budget: 500000000

default_context: mainnet
```

## Minimal configuration

The `site-builder` expects the configuration file in one of the following default locations: 

- The current directory
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/walrus/`
- `~/.config/walrus/`
- `~/.walrus/`

However, it is possible to specify a different directory by passing the `--config` flag to the `site-builder` command. For your first run, it should be sufficient to call the `site-builder` without specifying the configuration file explicitly, which is already configured if you followed the [configuration steps during installation](/docs/sites/getting-started/installing-the-site-builder#configuration).

If, for any reason, you did not add `walrus` to `$PATH`, make sure to configure a pointer to the binary.

## Additional options

If you want to have more control over the behavior of the `site-builder`, you can customize the following variables in the configuration file:

- `package`: The object ID of the Walrus Sites package on Sui. This is always required, and is already appropriately configured in `./sites-config.yaml`. Refer to the [Walrus Sites repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites) for package upgrades that require you to update this `package` field.

- `portal` (default: `wal.app`): The name of the portal through which you view the site. This only affects the output of the CLI and nothing else. All Walrus Sites are accessible through any portal independent of this setting.

- `general`: These are general options that can be configured both through the CLI and the configuration file.

  - `rpc_url`: The URL of the Sui RPC node to use. If not set, the `site-builder` infers it from the wallet.

  - `wallet` (default: uses the system-wide wallet from `sui client addresses`): Pointer to the Sui wallet to be used.

  - `walrus_binary` (default: runs from `$PATH`): Pointer to the `walrus` binary.

  - `walrus_config`: The configuration for the `walrus` client binary.

  - `gas_budget` (default: 500M MIST): The maximum amount of gas to spend for transactions.
