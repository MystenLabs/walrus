The `site-builder` uploads your web framework's output directory to Walrus and stores the metadata on Sui. Your directory needs an `index.html` file at the root to serve as the entry point. You can find various examples in the [Walrus Sites example repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/example-walrus-sites).

To learn the basics of publishing and updating a Walrus Site, deploy the `walrus-snake` game from the example repository.

## Clone and deploy `walrus-snake`

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites">

- [x] [Install and configure Walrus](/docs/getting-started/index).

- [x] [Install and configure the `site-builder`](/docs/sites/getting-started/installing-the-site-builder).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

First, clone the Walrus Sites example repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/example-walrus-sites.git && cd example-walrus-sites
```

Since the `walrus` and `site-builder` binaries and configuration files are placed in their default locations, you can immediately use the [`deploy` command](/docs/sites/getting-started/using-the-site-builder#deploy) to publish the `./walrus-snake` site:

```sh
$ site-builder --context=testnet deploy ./walrus-snake --epochs 1
```

Depending on the network, the duration of an epoch might vary. Visit the official [Walrus network release schedule](https://www.walrus.xyz/network-release-schedule) to view the most up-to-date epoch duration details.

## View your deployed site

How you access your site depends on which network you used:

- **Mainnet sites**: Can be accessed through any Mainnet portal. https://wal.app serves Walrus Sites on Mainnet by resolving SuiNS names that point to them.

- **Testnet sites**: Can be accessed through any Testnet portal. Walrus Foundation does not operate a Testnet portal. You can [self-host or run one locally](/docs/sites/portals/deploy-locally).

The console output at the end of a successful Walrus Sites deployment should look like the following:

```sh

⚠ wal.app only supports sites deployed on mainnet.
    To browse your testnet site, you need to self-host a portal:
    1. For local development: http://2ffmxm7jmglccr79htmpdbaeqezp2krgftue5pfq9f83tdqjsc.localhost:3000
    2. For public sharing: http://2ffmxm7jmglccr79htmpdbaeqezp2krgftue5pfq9f83tdqjsc.yourdomain.com:3000

    📖 Setup instructions: https://docs.wal.app/docs/sites/portals/deploy-locally.html#running-the-portal-locally

    💡 Tip: You may also bring your own domain (/docs/sites/custom-domains/bringing-your-own-domain)
            or find third-party hosted testnet portals.
```

:::info

The local development (option 1) link is for Testnet sites, and requires a self-hosted or local portal. The public sharing (option 2) link is only available on Mainnet.

This output tells you that, for each file in the folder, a new [Walrus quilt](/docs/system-overview/quilt) was created with a respective quilt ID. It also prints the Walrus Site object ID on Sui, which you can use to view the site in an explorer and link to a SuiNS name. Finally, the URL at which you can browse the site is displayed. The `deploy` command also saves this new site object ID to the `ws-resources.json`.

Here the default `sites-config.yaml` is implicitly used as the config for the `site-builder` that was set up in the [installation guide](/docs/sites/getting-started/installing-the-site-builder). The configuration file is necessary to ensure that the `site-builder` knows the correct Sui package for the Walrus Sites logic.

More details on the configuration of the `site-builder` can be found in the [advanced configuration](/docs/sites/getting-started/configuration-file-reference) section.

## Update the site

To update your site content, like changing the title from "eat all the blobs!" to "Glob all the Blobs!", make the edit in the `./walrus-snake/index.html` file.

You can then update the existing site by running the `deploy` command again. The `deploy` command uses the site object ID stored in `ws-resources.json` from the initial deployment to identify which site to update. You do not need to specify the object ID manually:

```sh
site-builder --context=testnet deploy --epochs 1 ./walrus-snake
```

The wallet you are using must be the owner of the Walrus Site object to be able to update it.

The output this time should be:

```sh

Browsing the provided URL should reflect any changes you have made to the site.

During updates, the `site-builder` removes and re-uploads all site resources together as a single quilt, even files you haven't modified. This approach offers significant benefits, including faster upload speeds and lower storage costs, especially when uploading many small files. The drawback is that you cannot update files individually; changing one file means re-uploading the entire quilt.
