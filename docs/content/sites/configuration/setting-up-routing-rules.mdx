## Specifying client-side routing (`routes`)

The `routes` section allows you to specify client-side routing rules for your site. This is useful when you want to use a single-page application (SPA) framework, such as React or Angular. The configuration in the `routes` object is a mapping from route keys to resource paths.

The **`routes` keys** are path patterns in the form `/path/to/some/*`, where the `*` character represents a wildcard.

:::info

Currently, the wildcard can only be specified at the end of the path. Therefore, `/path/*` is a valid path, while `/path/*/to` and `*/path/to/*` are not.

:::

The `routes` values are the resource paths that should be served when the route key is matched. These paths in the values **must** be valid resource paths, meaning that they must be present among the site's resources. The Walrus sites contract **aborts** if you try to create a route that points to a non-existing resource.

The simple routing algorithm is as follows:

- Whenever a resource path is not found among the sites resources, the portal tries to match the path to the `routes`.

- All matching routes are then lexicographically ordered, and the longest match is chosen.

- The resource corresponding to this longest match is then served.

In the previous example:

```json
"routes": {
  "/*": "/index.html",
  "/path/*": "/accounts.html",
  "/path/assets/*": "/assets/asset_router.html"
}
```

The following matchings occur:

- Browsing `/any/other/test.html` serves `/index.html`.

- Browsing `/path/test.html` serves `/accounts.html`, as it is a more specific match than the previous one.

- Similarly, browsing `/path/assets/test.html` serves `/assets/asset_router.html`.

`/index.html`, `/accounts.html`, and `/assets/asset_router.html` are all existing resources on the Walrus Sites object on Sui.

## Site name (`site_name`)

You can set a name for your Walrus Site through the optional `site_name` field in your `ws-resources.json` file. In case you have also provided a site name through the `--site-name` CLI flag, the CLI flag takes priority over the `site_name` field in the `ws-resources.json`, which is overwritten. If a site name is not provided at all, then a default name is used.

## Site object ID (`object_id`)

The optional `object_id` field in your `ws-resources.json` file stores the Sui object ID of your deployed Walrus Site.

The `site-builder deploy` command primarily uses this field to identify an existing site for updates. If a valid `object_id` is present, `deploy` targets that site for modifications. If this field is missing and no `--object-id` CLI flag is used, `deploy` publishes a new site. If successful, then the command automatically populates this `object_id` field in your `ws-resources.json`.

## Ignoring files from being uploaded

You can use the optional `ignore` field to exclude certain files or folders from being published. This is useful when you want to keep development files, secrets, or temporary assets out of the final build.

The `ignore` field is a list of resource paths to skip. Each pattern must start with a `/`, and might end with a `*` to indicate a wildcard match.

For example:

```json
"ignore": [
  "/private/*",
  "/secret.txt",
  "/images/tmp/*"
]
```

This configuration skips all files inside the `/private/` and `/images/tmp/` directories, as well as a specific file `/secret.txt`.

Wildcards are only supported in the **last position** of the path, for example, `/foo/*` is valid, but `/foo/*/bar` is not.
