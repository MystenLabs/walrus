All Walrus client commands are available in JSON mode, simplifying programmatic access to the [CLI](/usage/client-cli.mdx). All the command-line flags of the original CLI command can be specified in JSON format.

For example, to store a blob, run:

```sh
$ walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "store": {
                "files": ["README.md", "LICENSE"],
                "epochs": 100
            }
        }
    }'
```

Or, to read a blob using the blob ID:

```sh
$ walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "read": {
                "blobId": "4BKcDC0Ih5RJ8R0tFMz3MZVNZV8b2goT6_JiEEwNHQo"
            }
        }
    }'
```

All options, default values, and commands are equal to those of the [standard CLI mode](/usage/client-cli.mdx), except that they are written in camelCase instead of kebab-case.

The `json` command also accepts input from `stdin`.

The output of a `json` command is itself JSON-formatted to simplify parsing the results in a programmatic way. For example, the JSON output can be piped to the `jq` command for parsing and manually extracting relevant fields.
