This page shares several simple examples in different programming languages that showcase how to interact with Walrus through the various interfaces. They are located at https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples and described below.

There are also actual applications built on top of Walrus, the primary example being [Walrus Sites](/walrus-sites/intro.mdx), a framework for deploying websites and hosting them through Walrus blobs. The code is available in the [Walrus Sites repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites).

For an example of how to build a static website and store it as a Walrus Site with GitHub actions, look at the [CI workflow](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-docs.yaml) used to publish this documentation site. There is also a [Walrus Sites GitHub action](https://github.com/zktx-io/walrus-sites-ga) created by the community. This action is not created or officially supported by the Walrus team.

## Python

The [Python examples](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples/python) folder contains a number of examples:

- How to use the HTTP API to store and read a blob.

    `hello_walrus_webapi.py`
    </summary>
    <ImportContent source="documentation/examples/python/hello_walrus_webapi.py" mode="code" />
    </details>
- How to use the JSON API to store, read, and check the availability of a blob. Checking the certification of a blob illustrates reading the blob's corresponding Sui object.

    `hello_walrus_jsonapi.py`

    <ImportContent source="documentation/examples/python/hello_walrus_jsonapi.py" mode="code" />
    </details>
- How to track Walrus related events.
    <details>
    <summary>
    `track_walrus_events.py`
    </summary>
    <ImportContent source="documentation/examples/python/track_walrus_events.py" mode="code" />
    </details>

## JavaScript

A [JavaScript example](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples/javascript) is provided showing how to upload and download a blob through a web form using the HTTP API.

## Move

For more complex applications, you might want to interact with Walrus on-chain objects. For that purpose, deployed Walrus contracts are included [in the Walrus GitHub repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/contracts).

A basic [example contract](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/docs/examples/move) showcases how to import and use the Walrus objects.
