The [Walrus system object](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/blob/main/contracts/walrus/sources/system/system_state_inner.move) contains metadata about available and used storage and the price of storage per KB in [FROST](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs). These values are determined by 2/3 agreement between storage nodes for each storage epoch. You can pay to purchase storage space for specified durations. These space resources can be split, merged, and transferred, and can later be used to place a blob ID into Walrus.

Each Walrus storage epoch is represented by the Walrus system object, which contains a storage committee and various metadata about storage nodes, including the mapping between shards and storage nodes, available space, and current costs. Committee changes between epochs are managed by a set of [staking contracts](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus/tree/main/contracts/walrus/sources/staking) that implement a full delegated proof-of-stake system based on the WAL token.

You can view information about the Walrus system through the `walrus info` command. It provides an overview of current system parameters, such as the current epoch, the number of storage nodes and shards in the system, the maximum blob size, and the current cost in WAL for storing blobs:
```sh
$ walrus info
```

The console responds:
```sh
Walrus system information

Epochs and storage duration
Current epoch: 1
Start time: 2025-03-25 15:00:24.408 UTC
End time: 2025-04-08 15:00:24.408 UTC
Epoch duration: 14days
Blobs can be stored for at most 53 epochs in the future.

Storage nodes
Number of storage nodes: 103
Number of shards: 1000

Blob size
Maximum blob size: 13.6 GiB (14,599,533,452 B)
Storage unit: 1.00 MiB

Storage prices per epoch
(Conversion rate: 1 WAL = 1,000,000,000 FROST)
Price per encoded storage unit: 0.0001 WAL
Additional price for each write: 20,000 FROST

...
```

You can view additional information with various subcommands, including encoding parameters and sizes, BFT system information, and details about storage nodes in the current committee and next committee, if already selected. This information includes node IDs, stake distribution, and shard allocation. Run `walrus info --help` for a complete list of available subcommands.

You can check the health of storage nodes with the `walrus health` command. This command accepts different options to select which nodes to check. For example, `walrus health --committee` checks the status of all current committee members.
