This guide introduces all the concepts needed to build applications that use Walrus as a storage or availability layer. The [overview](/design/overview.mdx) provides more background and explains in more detail how Walrus operates internally.

This developer guide describes the following:

- [Components](/dev-guide/components.mdx) of Walrus of interest to developers that wish to use it for
  storage or availability.

- [Operations](/dev-guide/dev-operations.mdx) supported through client binaries, APIs, or Sui operations.

- [Cost](/dev-guide/costs.mdx) components of storage, how they are measured, and considerations for managing those.

- [The Sui structures](/dev-guide/sui-struct.mdx) Walrus uses to store metadata, and how they can be read from Sui smart contracts, or through the Sui SDK.

- [Data security](/dev-guide/data-security.mdx) guidance for encryption and access control of data stored on Walrus.
